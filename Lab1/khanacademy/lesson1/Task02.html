    <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
    Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
    There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
    And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
    <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</strong><br>
    Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
    <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
    Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
    One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
    Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger.</strong><br>
    <em>Failing is just another word for growing.</em> And you keep going.<br>
    <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
    It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
    <em>You just don’t get it, yet.</em><br>
    Because the most <strong>beautiful, complex concepts</strong> in the whole universe<br>
    are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
    Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    You only have to know one thing:<br>
    <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
